#+TITLE: Scraping Metadata

* Overview
Metadata collection is essentially processing existing =package.json=,
=package-lock.json=, =yarn.lock=, NPM registry info, etc from their original
format into our standardized set of records so that they may be used to
generate build recipes.

There are a wide variety of possible inputs that may be used to feed our
metadata creation/scraping systems.
Normalizing, caching, and merging metadata from various sources comprises the
bulk of this codebase which also means there's a lot for users to customize
and tailer to their projects' needs.

** =fenv=: /Floco Eval Environment/

In general metadata processing routines have been designed for reuse and
most carry a common set of =fenv= ( /Floco Eval Environment/ ) settings that
allow processing pipelines to be used for scraping and executing builds with
minimal modification - in most cases the defaults defined in
[[file:../lib/meta-ent.nix::metaSetFromDir' =][metaSetFromDir]] should
support the vast majority of projects /out of the box/.

** =metaEnt= Overlays
Metadata related to a single package is organized around a structure called
=metaEnt=, short for "metadata entry", a more detailed discussion of this
structure is covered [[file:./processes-and-metadata.org][here]].

Collecting, normalizing, and transforming =metaEnt= records is generally
handled by adding /overlays/, which we can think of as "layers", or
processes in a pipeline.

What makes /overlays/ special compared to regular functions is that they
are allowed to refer to data that may or may not be defined yet.
This accomplishes two things:
1. Most ( but not all ) overlays are not sensitive to order of operations.
   - This means I can simply state a definition for =hasBin= as
     ~hasBin = ( final.bin or final.directories.bin or {} ) != {}~ to say
     "in the finalized record, if =bin= or =directories.bin= are undefined
     or empty, then we do not have any bins".
     + Whether those fields are known at the time our overlay is "applied"
       doesn't matter, =hasBin= will be set to the correct value.
   - If either =bin= or =directories.bin= are modifed by another overlay
     applied later, our definition will be "updated" to reflect the change.
   - An earlier or later overlay can refer to =final.hasBin=, and Nix will
     automatically work out the correct order of operations for us.
2. Naive or slow overlays can be defined as "last resort" rules, and more
   optimized overlays ( often requiring =impure= or =ifd= ) may be overwrite
   those rules without needing to define an entirely new pipeline.
   - This is how =floco= is able to recycle metadata scraping routines to
     also be used as cache readers to feed builders.
   - This allows users to easily customize routines to collect data from
     alternative sources.

I want to highlight that I said "most overlays are not sensitive to order
of operations".
In an overlay any references to =prev.<FIELD>= as opposed to =final.<FIELD>=
are sensitive to ordering.
You will generally only see these used in very early stages of metadata
processing to do things like "given a directory name, set =metaFiles.pjs= to
the contents of =package.json= from that dir", or routines that optimize or
specialize fetchers.
These types of overlays are almost always processed at the very beginning
or very end of a pipeline in the default flows, and if you need more
concise control over order of operations don't hesistate to copy the
default pipeline and add, remove, or reorder overlays.

* Categories of Scrapers
Metadata collection and scraping routines fall into a few broad categories
based on their original source.

Some categories availability or internal behavior depend on =fenv= settings
like =pure= and =ifd= making some more suitable for "pre-build"
scraping/collection usage to produce a metadata cache or set of generated
builds, but a great deal of effort has been dedicated toward dynamically
generating build recipes with pure/non-IFD Nix evaluation.

** =package.json= Scraping ( =pjs= )
This is your set of bread and butter collection routines that are used to
create a =metaEnt= for any project with a "build" phase, test cases, or
runtime environment ( such as a dev-shell ).

Most routines related to =package.json= have "PJS" in their name, short for
"package JSON".
These are generally defined in [[file:../lib/pkginfo.nix][lib.libpkginfo]]
and [[file:../lib/pkg-json.nix][lib.libpjs]], but because these fields are
shared by the NPM package registry, and most lockfiles, you'll also find
routines in [[file:../lib/depinfo.nix][lib.libdepinfo]],
[[file:../lib/parse.nix][lib.libparse]],
[[file:../lib/events.nix][lib.libevents]],
[[file:../lib/system.nix][lib.libsys]],
and others that are applicable to these files.

Because of their flexibility, this is the most challenging form of metadata
to normalize.
There is no universal standard for fields in =package.json= and despite
NPM's dominance as the de-facto standard, Yarn, PNPM, ESM, etc have their
own extensions and variations that you might need to port with a shim.
The good news is that the vast majority of projects adhere to a few common
patterns that at least help us consume projects from distributed tarballs in
a relatively consistent manner.

The most developed parts of this framework are dedicated to supporting NPM's
standardized set of =package.json= fields, but you'll also find some older
routines floating around [[file:../lib/yarn][lib/yarn/*]] that may help you
port Yarn fields to NPM/Floco.

*** Precautions
One important thing to remember is: =package.json= is a freeform config,
and authors often define miscellaneous fields for internal use with a
particular package manager or build tool that could be misinterpreted if
you aren't careful.

The =engines= fields are often useful for determining which tooling the
authors wrote their file for.
This is perhaps most useful for discerning which versions of NPM or Yarn
were used in cases where those tools broke backwards compatibility.

I'll take this opportunity to note that this framework was developed
alongside NPM v8.11 and higher, with Node.js 14.
While I hope to have avoided biases based on those selections, I encourage
you to file issue/bug reports if you catch issues with LATER versions of
these tools.

*** Queries and Generic Utils
While most metadata processing is done using overlays and =metaEnt=
records, a large number =package.json= helper routines are defined that
can be used standalone directly.

- [[file:../lib/pkginfo.nix::rewriteDescriptors =][=lib.libpkginfo.rewriteDescriptors=]]
   Replace =package.json= style dependency descriptors ( ="^1.0.0"= )
   with new values either by overriding or transforming them.

   Takes an attrset of package names assigned to either strings
   or functions.
   For strings, override existing descriptors in package.json, for
   functions apply them to the existing value to produce a new descriptor.
