/**
 * A minimal `mkDerivation' alternate which is nice for many of the

 *
 * In many cases we will still use `nixpkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation', but this is
 * a nice trimmed down compromise between a "raw" derivation and the entire
 * kitchen sink that `nixpkgs' provides.
 *
 * XXX: Overlays, overrides, and other junk are no good here - we avoid using
 * `stdenv' intentionally.

  # If you need to (un)zip something do it in a separate derivation on it's own,
  # preferably by directly invoking `tar' with `ak-nix.tarutils'.
  # The rationale here is that if you unzip and move or `mkdir' or basically
  # look at the result funny - you'll cause a different CA hash and end up
  # with gazillions of redundant store paths that placed the same tarball in
  # a different subdir.
  # Instead, unzip ONCE, and symlink if you need the contents in a subdir.
  # Matching the registry tarball's integrity hash is critical!
