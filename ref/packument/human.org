#+TITLE: Human Object
Human objects have at least one of the following fields defined:

* name
a freeform string name
* email
an email address
* url
a url for a web page with more information about the author
Historically no validation has been performed on those fields; they are generated by parsing user-provided data in package.json at publication time.

* Example
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "email": "ben@example.com",
    "name": "Ben The Example"
}
#+END_SRC
